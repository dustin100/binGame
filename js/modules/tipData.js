		des: `Place Tim Hortons and other paper hot beverage cups in the garbage bin.

		tip: 'Clothing and textiles',
		img: './imgs/trashTip.png',
		des: `Old clothes, shoes, blankets, and curtains don’t belong in the Blue Bin. They can get caught in sorting machines, damage equipment and cause workplace injuries at the recycling facility. If your items can’t be donated, put them in the garbage.`,

	{
		tip: 'Clean containers only',
		img: './imgs/recycleTip.png',

		img: './imgs/trashTip.png',
		des: `These do not go in your Blue Bin. They can get tangled in sorting machines, damage equipment and cause workplace injuries at the recycling facility. See if your local electronics store has a recycling program. Throw unwanted cords, hoses and cables in your garbage.`,
